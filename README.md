# No Nonsense Screen Recorder

As developers, we often find ourselves working on multiple features, bug fixes, or small tweaks in our codebase. After finishing a task, we often need to provide a visual demonstration of the changes to our reviewers, especially when working on **Pull Requests (PRs)**. A simple screen recording to showcase the feature or fix can make all the difference. But here's the problem:

While there are plenty of screen recorder extensions available today on the Chrome Marketplace, they all have one thing in common—**complexity.**

Some require you to **sign up** and create accounts before you can even start recording.
Others have **too many steps** involved, making it feel like a hassle to just record a quick video.
And even more frustrating is that no one needs all those extra features when the goal is simple: record the screen, and share it.

After dealing with these frustrations for too long, I decided to build something that would solve this issue: **the No Nonsense Screen Recorder.**


### Why I Built It
My goal was simple: to create a screen recorder that's easy to use and gets the job done quickly. I was tired of dealing with extra steps, sign-ups, and complicated interfaces that other screen recording tools had.

So, I built this tool to solve my own problem. And if you’ve ever felt the same way about screen recorders, it might solve yours too.

**Minimal and Simple:** No sign-ups. No complex settings. Just click a button and start recording.

### How It Works
**Click "Start Recording":** The recording begins immediately with no need for unnecessary steps.

**Record your screen:** Capture either the full screen or just a specific tab, depending on what you're showcasing.

**Hit "Stop Recording":** When you're done, simply stop the recording and give the file a name.

**Save & Done:** Your recording is saved with the given file name and ready to be uploaded anywhere you need, like in your PR description for your reviewer to easily understand the changes.

###  Why "No Nonsense"?
Sometimes, you just want something that works. No distractions, no pop-ups, no sign-ups, and no hassle. Just a tool that helps you get the job done. **No nonsense.**

So, if you’re looking for a simple, easy-to-use screen recorder that doesn’t waste your time, give this a try. It’s built to get out of your way and let you focus on what matters—showcasing your work to your team.
